CartoDB Workshop
================

CartoDB is an online tool for quickly and easily building maps and map based
visualisations.

In this tutorial we will start by making a map in the first ten minutes.

We will then go on to discussing some of the concepts behind the map making
process - data formats and presentation being the big two.

Later we will look at how to take the simplest of maps and make it more
responsive, by both utilising live data and utilising data with dates to
make a map that shows changes over time.
