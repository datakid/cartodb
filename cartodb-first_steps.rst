There is a small wait before you are logged into your Dashboard.

At this point, creating a new map is as easy as dragging and dropping a
suitable file onto the map.

Alternatively, you can use the "New Map" button

A Suitable File
===============

CartoDB is robust - it will accept almost all data files that have geographic
data.

The most simple example of this is a comma separated values file, or CSV,
which can be created in Excel from a single page of data.

The only other requirements CartoDB has for data in CSV format are a header
row, and two columns, one latitude, one longitude.
